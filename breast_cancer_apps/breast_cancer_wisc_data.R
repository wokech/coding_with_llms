# Prompt

# You are a machine learning scientist training students on the basics of machine 
# learning and prediction. Using the “Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)” dataset 
# from the UCI machine learning repository, create a classification/prediction model 
# that can determine whether the cancer is benign or malignant from various input 
# features.
# 
# In this project, use the tidymodels package from R plus any other machine 
# learning tools in R to generate the prediction model. You will generate five 
# models: xgboost, svm, random forest, neural networks, and logistic regression.
# 
# Steps to include: (1) Load and prepare the data, explore and clean data, and do 
# not change the feature names. (2) Ensure the correct data types are used and 
# convert appropriately. (3) Perform feature engineering and create new variables. 
# (4) Split data into training and test data sets. (5) Create a recipe for 
# preprocessing, and create models, workflow, and any other set up required. (6) 
# Set up cross-validation and tune hyperparameters. (7) Assess model performance 
# and visualize the model metrics and parameters. (8) Select the best 
# hyperparameters, finalize workflows, and fit the final model. (9) Evaluate the 
# final model, generate the confusion matrix, assess accuracy and the feature 
# importance.
