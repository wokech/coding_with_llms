# Benchmark 1: Climate Data in Nairobi

# Prompt 1
# Persona: You are a data visualization specialist. Context: You have been tasked 
# with obtaining climate data about the city of Nairobi. Action: Access the 
# Wikipedia page for the city of Nairobi. Find the climate data for the Jomo 
# Kenyatta International Airport. Download/scrape the data. Plot a line graph 
# with month on the x-axis and temperature in degrees celsius (C) on the y-axis. 
# The line graph should contain three lines with values for the daily mean, mean 
# daily maximum, and mean daily minimum. The style/theme for the plot should be NY 
# Times. Write an R script that obtains, cleans, and visualizes the data. Tone: 
# Professional. Output Format: Provide an R script.

# If not listed below then it means that it failed to run!!!

# NOTE: Only Perplexity worked! Issue may be that search is always on with Perplexity??!!
