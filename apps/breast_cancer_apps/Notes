The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset contains 30 features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. Here's a list of these features with brief descriptions:

feature1: Radius mean (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
feature2: Texture mean (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
feature3: Perimeter mean
feature4: Area mean
feature5: Smoothness mean (local variation in radius lengths)
feature6: Compactness mean (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
feature7: Concavity mean (severity of concave portions of the contour)
feature8: Concave points mean (number of concave portions of the contour)
feature9: Symmetry mean
feature10: Fractal dimension mean ("coastline approximation" - 1)
feature11: Radius standard error
feature12: Texture standard error
feature13: Perimeter standard error
feature14: Area standard error
feature15: Smoothness standard error
feature16: Compactness standard error
feature17: Concavity standard error
feature18: Concave points standard error
feature19: Symmetry standard error
feature20: Fractal dimension standard error
feature21: Radius worst (mean of the three largest values)
feature22: Texture worst
feature23: Perimeter worst
feature24: Area worst
feature25: Smoothness worst
feature26: Compactness worst
feature27: Concavity worst
feature28: Concave points worst
feature29: Symmetry worst
feature30: Fractal dimension worst

These features are grouped into three categories:

Mean values (features 1-10)
Standard error (features 11-20)
"Worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) (features 21-30)

Each of these categories contains measurements for ten different characteristics of the cell nuclei. These detailed measurements allow for a comprehensive analysis of the cell nuclei's properties, which can be used to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors.
